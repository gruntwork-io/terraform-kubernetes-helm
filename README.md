# Tiller Module

This repo contains a Module for deploying Tiller (the server component of Helm) on Kubernetes clusters with
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io).  This repo is a part of [the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/), a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production
ready infrastructure code. Read the [Gruntwork Philosophy](GRUNTWORK_PHILOSOPHY.md) document to learn more about how
Gruntwork builds production grade infrastructure code.


## Quickstart Guide

The general idea is to:

1. Deploy a Kubernetes cluster. You can use one of the following:
    - [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
    - [Our GKE module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-gke/)
    - [Our EKS module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/)
1. Setup a `kubectl` config context that is configured to authenticate to the deployed cluster.
1. Install the necessary prerequisites tools:
    - [`helm` client](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#install-helm)
    - (Optional) [`kubergrunt`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt#installation)
1. Provision a [`Namespace`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) and
   [`ServiceAccount`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) to house the
   Tiller instance.
1. Deploy Tiller.

You can checkout the [`k8s-tiller-minikube` example documentation](/examples/k8s-tiller-minikube/README.md) for detailed
instructions on deploying against `minikube`.


## What is in this repo

This repo provides a Gruntwork IaC Package and has the following folder structure:

* [root](./): The root folder contains an example of how to deploy Tiller using
  [`kubergrunt`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt), which implements all the logic for deploying Tiller with
  all the security best practices.
* [modules](/modules): This folder contains the main implementation code for this Module, broken down into multiple
  standalone Submodules.

  The primary module is:

    * [k8s-tiller](/modules/k8s-tiller): Deploy Tiller with all the security features turned on. This includes using
      `Secrets` for storing state and enabling TLS verification.

    The deployed Tiller requires TLS certificate key pairs to operate. Additionally, clients will each need to their
    own TLS certificate key pairs to authenticate to the deployed Tiller instance. This is based on [kubergrunt model of
    deploying helm](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/blob/master/HELM_GUIDE.md).

    There are also several supporting modules that help with setting up the deployment:

    * [k8s-namespace](/modules/k8s-namespace): Provision a Kubernetes `Namespace` with a default set of RBAC roles.
    * [k8s-namespace-roles](/modules/k8s-namespace-roles): Provision a default set of RBAC roles to use in a `Namespace`.
    * [k8s-service-account](/modules/k8s-service-account): Provision a Kubernetes `ServiceAccount`.
    * [k8s-tiller-tls-certs](/modules/k8s-tiller-tls-certs): Generate a TLS Certificate Authority (CA) and using that,
      generate signed TLS certificate key pairs that can be used for TLS verification of Tiller. The certs are managed
      on the cluster using Kubernetes `Secrets`. **NOTE**: This module uses the `tls` provider, which means the
      generated certificate key pairs are stored in plain text in the Terraform state file. If you are sensitive to
      secrets in Terraform state, consider using `kubergrunt` for TLS management.
    * [k8s-helm-client-tls-certs](/modules/k8s-helm-client-tls-certs): Generate a signed TLS certificate key pair from a
      previously generated CA certificate key pair. This TLS key pair can be used to authenticate a helm client to
      access a deployed Tiller instance. **NOTE**: This module uses the `tls` provider, which means the generated
      certificate key pairs are stored in plain text in the Terraform state file. If you are sensitive to secrets in
      Terraform state, consider using `kubergrunt` for TLS management.

* [examples](/examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the Submodules. The [example root
  README](/examples/README.md) provides a quickstart guide on how to use the Submodules in this Module.
* [test](/test): Automated tests for the Submodules and examples.


## What is Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is an open source container management system for deploying, scaling, and managing
containerized applications. Kubernetes is built by Google based on their internal proprietary container management
systems (Borg and Omega). Kubernetes provides a cloud agnostic platform to deploy your containerized applications with
built in support for common operational tasks such as replication, autoscaling, self-healing, and rolling deployments.

You can learn more about Kubernetes from [the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).


## What is Helm?

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package and module manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and manage
Kubernetes applications as reusable packages called Charts. Helm provides support for official charts in their
repository that contains various applications such as Jenkins, MySQL, and Consul to name a few. Gruntwork uses Helm
under the hood for the Kubernetes modules in this package.

For a background on Helm and its security model, check out [our Helm Guide
document](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/blob/master/HELM_GUIDE.md).

## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.


## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
