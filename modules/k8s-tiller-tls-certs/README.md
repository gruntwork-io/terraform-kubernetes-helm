# K8S Tiller TLS Certs Module

This Terraform Module can be used to generate a Certificate Authority (CA) public key, that is then used to generate a
signed TLS certificate. These certs are then stored in a Kubernetes `Secret` so that they can be used with Tiller and
`kubergrunt` to manage authentication to Tiller.

If you are unfamiliar with how TLS works, checkout [this primer on
TLS/SSL](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/modules/private-tls-cert#background).

You can read more about Helm, Tiller, and their security model in our [Helm
guide](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/blob/master/HELM_GUIDE.md).

**WARNING: The private keys generated by this module will be stored unencrypted in your Terraform state file. If you are
sensitive to storing secrets in your Terraform state file, consider using `kubergrunt` to generate and manage your TLS
certificate. See [the k8s-tiller-kubergrunt-minikube example](/examples/k8s-tiller-kubergrunt-minikube) for how to use
`kubergrunt` for TLS management.**


## How do you use this module?

* See the [root README](/README.md) for instructions on using Terraform modules.
* This module uses [the `kubernetes` provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/index.html).
* See the [examples](/examples) folder for example usage.
* See [variables.tf](./variables.tf) for all the variables you can set on this module.
* See [outputs.tf](./outputs.tf) for all the variables that are outputed by this module.


## How do you use the generated TLS certs with Tiller?

This module will generate TLS certificate key pairs and store them in a Kubernetes `Secret`, outputting the name of the
`Secret`. You can then pass the `Secret` name (output variable `signed_tls_certificate_key_pair_secret_name`) to the
[k8s-tiller module](../k8s-tiller) as the input variable `tiller_tls_secret_name`. Tiller will then be able to find the
generated TLS certificate key pairs and mount them into the container so that the server can use it.


## How do you use the generated TLS certs with kubergrunt for client side TLS management?

`kubergrunt` provides TLS management features that can be used for managing client side TLS certs for use with `helm`.
This module is compatible with the `kubergrunt` approach, although it requires a few labels on the created `Secret`
resource so that `kubergrunt` can properly find the CA private key.

`kubergrunt` model of client side TLS management works by looking for the `Secret` that stores the CA certificate key
pair, which it can use to generate client side TLS certs to authenticate the client. These CA certs need to be the ones
used for generating the server side TLS certs, so that the two way verification works.

To allow `kubergrunt` to find the TLS certs, the following must be set:

```hcl
# kubergrunt looks for CA certs in the kube-system Namespace.
ca_tls_certificate_key_pair_secret_namespace = "kube-system"
# kubergrunt uses the following labels to look for Tiller related certs
ca_tls_certificate_key_pair_secret_labels = {
    "gruntwork.io/tiller-namespace" = "{NAME_OF_TILLER_NAMESPACE}"
    "gruntwork.io/tiller-credentials" = "true"
    "gruntwork.io/tiller-credentials-type" = "ca"
}
# kubergrunt uses the following name to look for the CA certs
ca_tls_certificate_key_pair_secret_name = "{NAME_OF_TILLER_NAMESPACE}-namespace-tiller-ca-certs"
```

With these input variables, `kubergrunt` should be able to locate the generated CA certs and use them to generate client
side certs when you use the `kubergrunt helm grant` command.


## How do you use the generated TLS certs to sign additional certificates?

In order to access Tiller, you will typically need to generate additional signed certificates using the generated TLS CA
certs. You have two options for generating the client side TLS certs:

- [Using the `k8s-helm-client-tls-certs` module](#using-the-k8s-helm-client-tls-certs-module)
- [Using `kubergrunt`](#using-kubergrunt)

#### Using the k8s-helm-client-tls-certs module

`k8s-helm-client-tls-certs` is designed to take a CA TLS cert generated using `k8s-tiller-tls-certs` and generate new
signed TLS certs that can be used as verified clients. To use the module for this purpose, you can either call out to
the module in your terraform code (like we do here to generate one for the operator), or use it directly as a temporary
module.

Follow these steps to use it as a temporary module:

1. Copy this module to your computer.
1. Open `variables.tf` and fill in the variables that do not have a default.
1. DO NOT configure Terraform remote state storage for this code. You do NOT want to store the state files as they will
   contain the private keys for the certificates.
1. DO NOT configure `store_in_kubernetes_secret` to `true`. You do NOT want to store the certificates in Kubernetes
   without the state file.
1. Run `terraform apply`.
1. Extract the generated certificates from the output and store to a file. E.g:

    ```bash
    terraform output tls_certificate_key_pair_private_key_pem > client.pem
    terraform output tls_certificate_key_pair_certificate_pem > client.crt
    terraform output ca_tls_certificate_key_pair_certificate_pem > ca.crt
    ```

1. Share the extracted files with the user.
1. Delete your local Terraform state: `rm -rf terraform.tfstate*`. The Terraform state will contain the private keys for
   the certificates, so it's important to clean it up!

The user can then install the certs and setup the client in a similar manner to the process described in [Verify Tiller
Deployment](#verify-tiller-deployment)

#### Using kubergrunt

`kubergrunt` automates this process in the `grant` and `configure` commands. For example, suppose you wanted to grant
access to the deployed Tiller to a group of users grouped under the RBAC group `dev`. You can grant them access using
the following command:

```
kubergrunt helm grant --tiller-namespace NAMESPACE_OF_TILLER --rbac-group dev --tls-common-name dev --tls-org YOUR_ORG
```

This will generate a new certificate key pair for the client and upload it as a `Secret`. Then, it will bind new RBAC
roles to the `dev` RBAC group that grants it permission to access the Tiller pod and the uploaded `Secret`.

This in turn allows your users to configure their local client using `kubergrunt`:

```
kubergrunt helm configure --tiller-namespace NAMESPACE_OF_TILLER --rbac-group dev
```

At the end of this, your users should have the same helm client setup as above.
