# Kubernetes Tiller Deployment On Minikube

The root folder of this repo shows an example of how to use Terraform to call out to our `kubergrunt` utility to deploy
Tiller (the server component of Helm) onto a Kubernetes cluster. Here we will walk through a detailed guide on how you
can setup `minikube` and use this module to deploy Tiller onto it.


## Background

We strongly recommend reading [our guide on Helm](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt/blob/master/HELM_GUIDE.md)
before continuing with this guide for a background on Helm, Tiller, and the security model backing it.


## Overview

In this guide we will walk through the steps necessary to get up and running with deploying Tiller using this module,
using `minikube` to deploy our target Kubernetes cluster. Here are the steps:

1. [Install and setup `minikube`](#setting-up-your-kubernetes-cluster-minikube)
1. [Install the necessary tools](#installing-necessary-tools)
1. [Apply the terraform code](#apply-the-terraform-code)
1. [Verify the deployment](#verify-tiller-deployment)
1. [Granting access to additional roles](#granting-access-to-additional-users)
1. [Upgrading the deployed Tiller instance](#upgrading-deployed-tiller)


## Setting up your Kubernetes cluster: Minikube

In this guide, we will use `minikube` as our Kubernetes cluster to deploy Tiller to.
[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) is an official tool maintained by the Kubernetes community to be
able to provision and run Kubernetes locally your machine. By having a local environment you can have fast iteration
cycles while you develop and play with Kubernetes before deploying to production.

To setup `minikube`:

1. [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
1. [Install the minikube utility](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
1. Run `minikube start` to provision a new `minikube` instance on your local machine.
1. Verify setup with `kubectl`: `kubectl cluster-info`

**Note**: This module has been tested to work against GKE and EKS as well. You can checkout the examples in the
respective repositories for how to deploy Tiller on those platforms. <!-- TODO: link to examples -->


## Installing necessary tools

In addition to `terraform`, this guide uses `kubergrunt` to manage TLS certificates for the deployment of Tiller. You
can read more about the decision behind this approach in [the Appendix](#appendix-a-why-kubergrunt) of this guide.

This means that your system needs to be configured to be able to find `terraform`, `kubergrunt`, and `helm` client
utilities on the system `PATH`. Here are the installation guide for each:

1. [`terraform`](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
1. [`helm` client](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm)
1. [`kubergrunt`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt#installation), minimum version: v0.3.6

Make sure the binaries are discoverble in your `PATH` variable. See [this stackoverflow
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix) for instructions on
setting up your `PATH` on Unix, and [this
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) for instructions on
Windows.


## Apply the Terraform Code

Now that we have a working Kubernetes cluster, and all the prerequisite tools are installed, we are ready to deploy
Tiller! To deploy Tiller, we will use the example Terraform code at the root of this repo:

1. If you haven't already, clone this repo:
    - `git clone https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-kubernetes-helm.git`
1. Make sure you are at the root of this repo:
    - `cd terraform-kubernetes-helm`
1. Initialize terraform:
    - `terraform init`
1. Apply the terraform code:
    - `terraform apply`
    - Fill in the required variables based on your needs. <!-- TODO: show example inputs here -->

The Terraform code creates a few resources before deploying Tiller:

- A Kubernetes `Namespace` (the `tiller-namespace`) to house the Tiller instance. This namespace is where all the
  Kubernetes resources that Tiller needs to function will live. In production, you will want to lock down access to this
  namespace as being able to access these resources can compromise all the protections built into Helm.
- A Kubernetes `Namespace` (the `resource-namespace`) to house the resources deployed by Tiller. This namespace is where
  all the Helm chart resources will be deployed into. This is the namespace that your devs and users will have access
  to.
- A Kubernetes `ServiceAccount` (`tiller-service-account`) that Tiller will use to apply the resources in Helm charts.
  Our Terraform code grants enough permissions to the `ServiceAccount` to be able to have full access to both the
  `tiller-namespace` and the `resource-namespace`, so that it can:
    - Manage its own resources in the `tiller-namespace`, where the Tiller metadata (e.g release tracking information) will live.
    - Manage the resources deployed by helm charts in the `resource-namespace`.
- Using `kubergrunt`, generate a TLS CA certificate key pair and a set of signed certificate key pairs for the server
  and the client. These will then be uploaded as `Secrets` on the Kubernetes cluster.

These resources are then passed into the `k8s-tiller` module where the Tiller `Deployment` resources will be created.
Once the resources are applied to the cluster, this will wait for the Tiller `Deployment` to roll out the `Pods` using
`kubergrunt helm wait-for-tiller`.

Finally, to allow you to use `helm` right away, this code also sets up the local `helm` client. This involves:

- Using the CA TLS certificate key pair, create a signed TLS certificate key pair to use to identify the client.
- Upload the certificate key pair to the `tiller-namespace`.
- Grant the RBAC entity access to:
    - Get the client certificate `Secret` (`kubergrunt helm configure` uses this to install the client certificate
      key pair locally)
    - Get and List pods in `tiller-namespace` (the `helm` client uses this to find the Tiller pod)
    - Create a port forward to the Tiller pod (the `helm` client uses this to make requests to the Tiller pod)

- Install the client certificate key pair to the helm home directory so the client can use it.

At the end of the `apply`, you should now have a working Tiller deployment with your `helm` client configured to access
it. So let's verify that in the next step!


## Verify Tiller Deployment

To start using `helm` with the configured credentials, you need to specify the following things:

- enable TLS verification
- use TLS credentials to authenticate
- the namespace where Tiller is deployed

These are specified through command line arguments. If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to access
the Tiller that was deployed with the following args:

```
helm version --tls --tls-verify --tiller-namespace NAMESPACE_OF_TILLER
```

If you have access to Tiller, this should return you both the client version and the server version of Helm.

Note that you need to pass the above CLI argument every time you want to use `helm`. This can be cumbersome, so
`kubergrunt` installs an environment file into your helm home directory that you can dot source to set environment
variables that guide `helm` to use those options:

```
. ~/.helm/env
helm version
```

<!-- TODO: Mention windows -->


## Granting Access to Additional Users

Now that you have deployed Tiller and setup access for your local machine, you are ready to start using `helm`! However,
you might be wondering how do you share the access with your team? To do so, you can rely on `kubergrunt helm grant`.

In order to allow other users access to the deployed Tiller instance, you need to explicitly grant their RBAC entities
permission to access it. This involves:

- Granting enough permissions to access the Tiller pod
- Generating and sharing TLS certificate key pairs to identify the client

`kubergrunt` automates this process in the `grant` and `configure` commands. For example, suppose you wanted to grant
access to the deployed Tiller to a group of users grouped under the RBAC group `dev`. You can grant them access using
the following command:

```
kubergrunt helm grant --tiller-namespace NAMESPACE_OF_TILLER --rbac-group dev --tls-common-name dev --tls-org YOUR_ORG
```

This will generate a new certificate key pair for the client and upload it as a `Secret`. Then, it will bind new RBAC
roles to the `dev` RBAC group that grants it permission to access the Tiller pod and the uploaded `Secret`.

This in turn allows your users to configure their local client using `kubergrunt`:

```
kubergrunt helm configure --tiller-namespace NAMESPACE_OF_TILLER --rbac-group dev
```

At the end of this, your users should have the same helm client setup as above.


## Appendix A: Why kubergrunt?

This Terraform example is not idiomatic Terraform code in that it relies on an external binary, `kubergrunt` as opposed
to implementing the functionalities using pure Terraform providers. This approach has some noticeable drawbacks:

- You have to install extra tools to use, so it is not a minimal `terraform init && terraform apply`.
- Portability concerns to setup, as there is no guarantee the tools work cross platform. We make every effort to test
  across the major operating systems (Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows), but we can't possibly test every combination and so
  there are bound to be portability issues.
- You don't have the declarative Terraform features that you come to love, such as `plan`, updates through `apply`, and
  `destroy`.

That said, we decided to use this approach because of limitations in the existing providers to implement the
functionalities here in pure Terraform code.

`kubergrunt` fulfills the role of generating and managing TLS certificate key pairs using Kubernetes `Secrets` as a
database. This allows us to deploy Tiller with TLS verification enabled. We could instead use the `tls` and `kubernetes`
providers in Terraform, but this has a few drawbacks:

- The [TLS provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/tls/index.html) stores the certificate key pairs in plain
  text into the Terraform state.
- The Kubernetes Secret resource in the provider [also stores the value in plain text in the Terraform
  state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/r/secret.html).
- The grant and configure workflows are better suited as CLI tools than in Terraform.

`kubergrunt` works around this by generating the TLS certs and storing them in Kubernetes `Secrets` directly. In this
way, the generated TLS certs never leak into the Terraform state as they are referenced by name when deploying Tiller as
opposed to by value.

Note that we intend to implement a pure Terraform version of this functionality, but we plan to continue to maintain the
`kubergrunt` approach for folks who are wary of leaking secrets into Terraform state.
